In terms of the National Credit Act 34 of 2005, consumers are entitled to free copies of their credit reports once a year. It is advisable that one obtains their credit reports from at least four of the major credit bureau, as consumer credit information, contained in credit reports, can vary amongst the different credit bureau. If you already have your credit report and would like a non-obligatory credit repair assessment or if you want help to get your credit report.</p>

                     <h2>Debt Mediation</h2>
                     <p>Consumers who want to settle any debt, must keep in mind that many creditors will offer a reduced settlement amount. This is generally a discounted amount of the outstanding balance and is valid for a limited period of time. Factors such as how “old” the debt is, the amount of the claim, whether any legal action has been taken pursuant to the claim arising can also affect the debt settlement negotiation process and the final settlement amount offered by the creditor.</p>

                                 <p><b>Wilson</b> considered taking his own life due to Debt Administrators who were overcharging him while failing to pay his debt. <b>Succes Credit</b> helped him rescind his administration order and made arrangements with his credit providers to accept significantly reduced payments.
                                    <b>Wilson</b> went under administration attempting to get his debt under control. Unfortunately, the debt administrators recommended by his cousin had everything but good intentions. While charging exorbitant fees, they failed to pay his credit providers consistently, and didn’t keep him notified about his balances. By the time his credit providers contacted him, he owed more than he did before, but was stuck under administration, which had been implemented by a court order. The stress became so great. According to <b>Wilson, SCS </b>came along just in time. <b>Success Credit</b> helped him rescind his administration court order, and negotiated reduced payments with his credit providers, on condition that they would receive payment via a voluntary payroll deduction. <i> "Now I am a free man, and my family is happy, because they can see that I am is happy."</i>

                              <p><b>Roland</b> found himself overwhelmed with debt and struggling to provide for his family in Lesotho. <b>SCS</b> helped him get back on track by negotiating with his credit providers to reduce his monthly debt payments.

                                 <i>“Before I got myself into debt, I had a good life.”</i>
                                 <b>Roland</b> works at a mine in Rustenburg, but his family lives in Durban, where he visits them once a month. He took out some loans to make ends meet but, as payments piled up, he soon found he didn’t have enough money to send to his wife and children. His wife grew suspicious and accused him of having an affair, but he didn’t know how to open up about being over-indebted. He credits his manager for realising that many workers in his shaft were struggling to concentrate as they were always thinking about their debts. After his manager introduced them to SCS, Roland says he realised his manager actually cared about them.<b>Now, with his monthly instalments reduced from R9 300 to R3 100</b>, he’s paying off his debt at a more affordable amount while taking care of his family’s essential needs.
